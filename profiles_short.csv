Equally appropriate is the proliferation of hotels and boarding houses, ancillaries to the twin monoliths in the area, Olympia and Earls Court Exhibition Halls. Covering all standards of accommodation, they are perhaps the sole unifying element of this postcode.  Facilities in W14 are very much geared for visitors. Slap bang in the middle of W14 is the cavernous Kensington Olympia, built in 1884 and able to supply a gargantuan 37,000 square metres of exhibition space split between its three constituent halls. In recent decades it has had to play second fiddle to the even larger Earls Court Hall - just over the border in SW5 - but with both places now owned by the same firm the two quite happily complement each other.    T;;"We are close to Kensington Olympia train and tube station, Hammersmith and Shepherds Bush.  There are useful buses that leave from Shepherds Bush (7 minutes walk) and from Hammersmith Road (10 minutes walk).  It is a very well located apartment; the nearest main line station is Padditington and the nearest airport is Heathrow.  Gatwick is very easy to access via Kensington Olympia train station which means  you do not need to head into Victoria to get the train.

We couldn't recommend more our neighbourhood which still holds so much uniqueness to enjoy with its cross-cultural cuisine.

Others will prefer to visit Regents Park, wandering along the Regent's Canal, which will lead to punk neighborhood Camden Town via the romantic Little Venice. The more adventurous will discover the BoBo area of Kensal Rise with its antique shops and coffee places. `  To get the real feel of the neighbourhood, it is worthwhile to move beyond the street market and the images conjured up by the eponymous movie, and walk down some of the streets away from Portobello Road and Notting Hill Gate. Just spending a day in the boutiques of Ledbury Road and Westbourne Grove, or whiling away time people watching in one of the many cafes and bars will help you appreciate why the area has become one of London's most popular and expensive places to live. ;Public transports:  -Underground:  Ladbroke Grove (Circle Line + Hammersmith and City Line), only 3 minutes walk from the Portobello Room.

So if you need somewhere comfortable, clean, sunny, and quiet, that is easy to get into town from, in an interesting multicultural area where real people actually live, then this apartment is great! Central London is pretty big. Yet thanks to the bend in the river Thames, the flat is equidistant to most places of interest - Westminster, Soho, the West End, Covent Garden, and the City of London are a short bus journey away.  The area isn't London's most glamorous, but it is convenient.  Local facilities are great for buying provisions. Not only are good British supermarkets under five ;Check in is flexible, but you do need to provide arrival details in advance.

The room is for one or two people, there is no space for a third person, and the flat is not suitable for a baby or small child. This is a private house, not a hostel or commercial property. If you prefer that kind of service, please book elsewhere.  All the information guests usually require is hopefully stated here, so please double check your questions before asking, or committing to book. Should you then not see the answer to your question, then ask!;BUS The buses from the Walworth Road, which is five minutes walk away, are frequent and the best way get here. It takes as little as 20 minutes to all of central London, with 11 routes during the day, and 7 routes all night TUBE The nearest tube station is Elephant and Castle (in zone 1) is 16 minutes walk away, and is on two lines, Bakerloo and Northern.

They are very pleasant to sit beside with a drink in the summer, to walk by, or just to watch people cycling and walking their dogs.

It has a very unique character, but it only takes 16 minutes to get to London Bridge (for Tate modern;Tower Bridge;Globe Theatre;The Tower of London;St Paul's Cathedral) and 22 minutes to Charing Cross (within walking distance of Trafalgar Square; The National Gallery and Portrait Gallery; Horseguards Parade (for the spectacular Horse mounted Changing of the Guard);10 Downing Street;Big Ben;Houses of Parliament;Westminster Abbey;Buckingham Palace and Tate Britain).  Ladywell station is less than 2 minutes walk, and the village itself has a lovely feel and some really great shops. Probably of most interest to visitors are the cafes and restaurants.There is a French Patisserie/cafe on the corner by the station with great croissants and Oscars, a little independent cafe with a tiny garden, where the German lady owner bakes all her own delicious cakes and great coffee. There is also a traditional English cafe, ";;Public transport in London is absolutely excellent, and I chose to buy in Ladywell because of the amazing transport links. I work in central London, so a super fast route is essential to me. A word about trains versus tubes. In North London, most of the transportation is underground, in South London, which is less crowded, it is mostly overground. All the lines connect to each other, so just think of it all as one system. My house is so near the station you will be amazed - I can run there is 55 seconds, or walk in under 2 minutes. There are four trains per hour into London (roughly every 15 minutes). Two go direct to Charing Cross, and the fast ones go direct from Ladywell to London Bridge. This is amazing travel for such a huge city. The other two per hour go to Cannon Street in the City of London. You just take whichever train comes first. If it is a Cannon Street train, you change at London Bridge, and either cross to platform 6, where there is a train to Charing cross every 2 to 3;Wifi is super fast, and included in the price you pay.

The kitchen has a microwave, and cooker if you want to heat up meals at other times. There is a garden, and I occasionally have smokers, who are permitted to smoke in the garden, but not in the house.;I expect my guests to be quiet and respectful, and I find that most people are, but please be aware that there are other people staying in the house, so don't have your TV or music turned up too loud. A recent problem has been couples staying up late and chatting way into the night. Most people are super respectful, so I only mention it in passing. But there are a couple things that I need to mention. All trash in the UK has to be recycled, so please try to use the re-cycling that I provide in the kitchen (I will show you if you ask me) and separate wet waste from dry. Plastics have to be free of food contamination, so please either rinse it, or put it in the dishwasher and I will take care of it.

There is Hackney picturehouse (nearest, about 15 min walk away), or so many more in the area... quirky and different to the generic versions found in central London. Restaurants - too many to count. Vietamese food is a speciality around here.  Broadway Market, Victoria Park Village, Mare St, Hackney Road, Colombia Road.... loads of good restaurants around. oh! and if you can.. catch a play or opera or show at the beautiful 113 year old Hackney Empire.;I can't find where I can add this, but I do have a smoke detector in the flat. The flat is situated on the 2nd floor and it is only accessible via the stairs.;The flat is (literally) about 4 mins walk to the nearest bus stop. Buses from there will practically take you to anywhere you need to go. I'm talking.. Central London, London Bridge, Liverpool Street, Stratford, Hackney Central, Bethnal Green tube.. you name it, this bus stop will take you there (well the bus will, not the actual stop).  If you prefer to walk to the tube - that's Bethnal Green and it's about 12 mins to walk. If you walk slowly, it'll take you 15 minutes.  Hackney Central is the nearest overground, which takes 20-25 mins to walk, or a 5 minute bus journey (I wouldn't count Cambridge Heath Road station even though that's only 5 minutes away.. but it's not as useful as Hackney Central).;Guests get the whole flat. Keys include access to the gate in the communal garden area which takes you to the canal tow path. You can store your bike downstairs under the stairs (if you have a bike that is). Free carparking in the carpark.;- Please treat the home as you would your own - Please respect the neighbours, and so not make significant noise or play loud music after 10pm - No parties - Please wash all dishes before you check out - If guests lock themselves out of the property OR they do not place keys in the lockbox at checkout, a £50 fee will apply.

I don't want to use the phrase ""up and coming"" because everyone says that about many areas of London, but there are some great pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants in the local area, and you can travel some short distances to find more, such as in Dalston, Hackney central or Stoke Newington - and slightly further, Shoreditch.  Chatsworth Road, only 10 mins walk away, has a great Sunday market, many stalls, food, antiques and various stuff, and some great places to eat and drink. I'm also very close to the Lea Valley and Walthamstow Marshes, which has some great walks down the river, cycling, or jogging if you need somewhere to run to or around. I even believe you can go horse riding.  Very happy to answer questions about this, and to recommend place to eat or drink.";;Clapton overground station is a short walk, and trains will take you to Liverpool Street (which is on the central line) in 12 minutes, and to Walthamstow in the other direction (Victoria line). Hackney Central is a 15 min walk (5mins by bus), trains go to Islington (connects to Victoria line - easy for Oxford Street), Camden, Shepherds Bush in one direction, and Stratford if you want to go shopping at Westfield in the other.  If you want to get the Piccadilly Line, which takes you into central London very easily, there is a bus to Manor House or Finsbury Park (Piccadilly & Victoria line) which takes about 15 mins.  There are great bus links. If you want to go to Dalston, Stoke Newington, Shoreditch, Oxford Street, Soho, Leicester Square, Victoria, Euston, London Bridge, the City, St Pauls, Clerkenwell, Stratford,Walthamstow, Leyton, there are buses that will take you there directly.

As long as people know how to live alongside another person with respect and fun, I'm usually happy. If you're having a boyfriend, girlfriend, friend or parent come and stay if you're hear for a longer period, I usually say for 3-4 nights - after that there's an extra charge per night - prices on the listing.

Otherwise it is a business booking category. If the person booking cannot be there it must be agreed in advance as to who is to pick up keys and valid ID should be shown to photocopy. I need to mention this as some people are not clear and although Ive had this confirmed by Airbnb they believe a one can come in and just take my keys to my home without being vetted - they cannot. It must be agreed and I also usually meet a group as generally they arrive around the same time and I believe it is polite to say if this will not be possible, in advance.

Kitchen for making meals, ;none;We live in an emerging and buzzy part of London - the eastern edge of Hackney: Clapton - though, as we are local, we actually refer to our very particular corner as Homerton.    We have some pubs that are really very good - food, beer and cocktails - at the end of our road.;We have plenty of reviews for the same house and rooms on our other listings.   We should mention here - our house (and perhaps our disposition, if we are honest) is really not suited to kids.  That is randomly defined, by us, as under 12. Parking requires a resident's permit. This charged at cost to you. Please ask us about parking and we'll let you know the associated costs.   For those staying for longer term, we expect that you will be pretty independent and look after your own food, etc. Also, we will need to work out bathroom schedules, general house-keeping guidelines and such.;We are 10-15 minutes walk (well, 6 if you walk particularly fast) to Homerton Overground station.  And our favourite bus, the 242, is pretty close to the house - it will take you to great places in style.  And home again.  At ANY hour (maybe with less style after 2 am);Kitchen for making meals, garden for fresh air (or smoke), bathroom and your room - and wifi of course. Other amenities by invitation.  Generally, however, we would prefer that you are not just hanging around the house all day, as we work from home.;We love our home and we love sharing it.  A few things to make it a fabulous stay:  We don't smoke - occasional smokers are welcome, if you do smoke, use the ashtray in the back garden and don't smoke out front of the house.  Even if we aren't watching. Normally we don't expect visitors of guests to be at the house after eleven pm, if you want to have visitors later, please arrange this with me beforehand.  Being out and arriving home at your leisure is fine though - we don't have curfews.  And we aren't bothered about what time you decide to get up.  Help yourself to breakfast when it suits you. As there are open stairs (no railings), please do keep your wits about you.   (I should mention, it's not a child-friendly house). And please bear in mind it's a shared bathroom. Otherwise we are very flexible and I hope that people treat my home like they would their own home.;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/11d14433-648e-4c40-90cf-a945a2998be8.jpg?aki_policy=large;London, United Kingdom;LB of Hackney;London;Townhouse;"{Wifi,Kitchen,""Paid parking off premises"",""Pets live on this property"",Cat(s),Heating,Washer,""Smoke alarm"",""Carbon monoxide alarm"",""First aid kit"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49"",""translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50"",""Hot water"",Microwave,""Coffee maker"",Refrigerator,Dishwasher,""Dishes and silverware"",""Cooking basics"",Oven,Stove,""Garden or backyard"",""Luggage dropoff allowed"",""Long term stays allowed"",""Host greets you""}";$47.00

From STANSTED, take the Stansted Express - leave bags at Liverpool Street train station.  Or get closer to my place and leave them at Paddington.

Top travel tip 1: Get the 'CITYMAPPER' app.  Excellent app showing all London bus, tube, overground, cycle and walking directions between points - plus all costs and timings.  Highly recommended. Top travel tip 2:  Get a London Oyster card if you don't have a debit or credit card with contactless technology (all London tubes, trains and buses use contactless technology); top it up with a week's pass or £10 or whatever suits you. This will get you to the flat via London train, tube or bus.   Cycles for hire:  Right outside the flat is London's Cy";My guest room is part of my home where I live.

Because I go to bed around 11pm and wake around 7am, I would ask you to respect this and keep volume to a minimum during these times.;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/5994635/64b4228c_original.jpg?aki_policy=large;London, United Kingdom;City of Westminster;London;Apartment;"{""Cable TV"",Internet,Wifi,Kitchen,Breakfast,""Buzzer/wireless intercom"",Heating,Washer}";$73.00

The room has a double bed with a comfortable, quality mattress, bedlinen, towels and wifi, and is bright and airy with a huge sash window which overlooks the back gardens, so is quiet and peaceful, yet very convenient for central London.

Within 20-30 minutes walk are Borough Market, the London Eye, South Bank, Tate Modern, Shakespeare's Globe, the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey, and all transport amenities are on the doorstep. There's a great gastropub (The Albert Arms) a two minute walk away; the fabulous Mercato Metropolitano, a lively, Italian food-market/cinema/gym/community space is five minutes away and open all day until 11pm – the pizzas, wines and coffee are highly recommended, and the atmosphere is unbeatable. The flat is centrally located with superb transport links, so it's fast and easy to get to anywhere you want to explore, but the street itself is quiet and feels like stepping ba";;The area has excellent public transport links - buses, tube and railway stations all just moments walk away, plus hire bikes across the street. The flat is a fantastic base for walking into town too.;I live here too although I'm often away, or in and out, but always available to answer any questions before or during your stay, and very happy to assist if you need anything – or leave you in peace if you prefer privacy.

It is an area of significant historical importance and is recorded as part of the 'Ossulstone' hundred in the county of Middlesex in the Domesday Book of 1086.  In the Middle Ages and Tudor times, it was a very small village a few miles from the city of London, frequently visited by wayfarers as a pit stop before journeying north. More recently, Stoke Newington has undergone major gentrification, much of this based around Church Street (5 minutes walk), where there are many independent shops, pubs, bars and cafes. Just beyond Church Street, on Saturday mornings, St Paul's churchyard in Stoke Newington High Street hosts an active farmers' market and this was the first farmers' market in the UK to have only organic and biodynamic producers.
